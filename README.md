# hello-world
my first repository

This Travis Yano's first experience with GitHub. He is working with very bright minds and hopefully learning new skills from the internal search team.

I like animals as my father was a veternarian and so I am happy to open my home to creatures that need a safe, loving and fun home to reside in.

I garden in the summer, it's a family hobby, and play golf with some very old friends every tuesday afternoon...it's one of my favorite outlets during the week.

I also split season tickets to both MN Gopher hockey and basketball....which breaks up the long winters here in MN.
